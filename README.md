# My-Professional-Portfolio
This is a html webpage designed with advanced CSS techniques I learned during the 2nd week of UW Coding Bootcamp. Bootcamp,

In this project, I utilize CSS concepts to create a webpage that displays my work and information about me.
For the CSS, major components I use are:
- Flexboxes
- Margin and padding properties
- Google Fonts
- Advanced CSS to create a more interactive webpage
- Color variables

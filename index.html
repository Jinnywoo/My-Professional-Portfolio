                <p> 
                    Hey! My name is Andrew and I am a recent graduate at the University of Washington. I majored in Biology and originally wanted to go into the medical field as a surgeon. Currently, I am enrolled in the UW Fullstack Bootcamp as a part-time student to change my career path.</p>
                <p> 
                    Some of my hobbies include gaming and art, I also enjoy      working out casually (Although sometimes I enjoy eating a bit <strong>
                    too</strong> much and end up right back where I started).
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>My Work</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently I am taking some time off from my job as a Server at Niku Niku Japanese BBQ in order to focus more on my career change into a Fullstack Engineer. I am currently working on Advanced CSS techniques and soon moving onto Javascript.  
                </p>
